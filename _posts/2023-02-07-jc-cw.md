Today, I presented results from one of my recent works at the [CosmicWispers](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA21106/) virtual journal club.
In this paper with my former student we showed how the statistical analysis of data from observations of SN1987A can be improved to learn even more about axions!
You can find the preprint on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09764).

By the way, CosmicWispers is as COST Action project to bring together researchers with common interests.
Like my own project, it is funded by the European Union.
