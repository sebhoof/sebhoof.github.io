On 25 January, I had the pleasure of presenting a seminar for the Nikhef Theory Group in Amsterdam.
My talk, titled "Tools for Axion Model Predictions and Prospects for Their Detection in Astrophysics," explored the exciting potential of axions as a cornerstone in our understanding of fundamental physics.

If you're interested in the background material, here are related arXiv links: [[arXiv:1810.07192]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07192), [[arXiv:2101.08789]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08789), [[arXiv:2107.12378]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12378), and [[arXiv:2306.00077]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00077).
These works highlight some of my contributions to the tools and methodologies that enable precise predictions for axion models, as well as their implications for astrophysical observations.

Many thanks to the Nikhef Theory Group for the invitation and their hospitality!
