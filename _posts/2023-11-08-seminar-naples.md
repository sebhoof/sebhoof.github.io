While visiting the Theoretical Physics Group at the University of Naples, Italy, I talked about searches for axions and axion-like particles, highlighting some of the main results from works since my doctoral studies.
I thank the local group for giving me this opportunity, and for creating a welcoming atmosphere in what is possibly one of the most intriguing cities in Italy!
