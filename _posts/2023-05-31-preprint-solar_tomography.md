One of the main ways to document research results is in the form of articles in research journals.
Many scientific disciplines have luckily also adopted the practice of releasing preprints, i.e. scientific articles which still have to undergo the peer review process.
This facilitates the rapid communication of upcoming research results and can start discussions in the scientific community -- without financial barriers to access.

The first preprint related to the "AxiTools" project can now be found on the [arXiv preprint server](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00077).
We demonstrated how the detection of axions could tell us how the solar temperature changes in different layers inside the Sun.
More details to follow.

As always, it was a pleasure to collaborate with Joerg Jaeckel and Lennert Thormaehlen from the University of Heidelberg (Germany) on this work.
