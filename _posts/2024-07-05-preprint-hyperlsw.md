Today, my collaborators and I released a preprint on the [arXiv preprint server](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04772), disucssing the feasibility of future axion facilities in case of a discovery.
We asked ourselves what the most ambitious laboratory experiments could achieve when using only currently available technology.
This exercise provided important benchmarks for our ability to determine the axion's properties and, in particular, to make robust statements about the amount of dark matter explained by them.

It was a pleasure to collaborate with Joerg Jaeckel and Giuseppe Lucente from the University of Heidelberg (Germany) on this work!
