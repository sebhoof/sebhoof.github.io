On 5 April, I presented an overview of the work activities of the action in the "Particles & Cosmology" seminar series hosted by the Laboratoire de Physique Théorique et Hautes Énergies (LPTHE) in Paris.
My talk, titled "Finding Axions in a Universe of Data and Envisioning Their Use as Multi-Messenger Probes," explored the exciting role of axions as both a theoretical puzzle and a practical tool for exploring the cosmos.

Many thanks to the group leader for the opportunity to present my workand for the hospitality!
