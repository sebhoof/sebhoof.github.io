The MSCA project "AxiTools" was awarded high-performance computing time from the Italian SuperComputing Resource Allocation (ISCRA) scheme.
I will conduct a "Class C" project on the GALILEO100 cluster to learn more about axions coming from the Sun.
Find out more about the ISCRA scheme [here](https://www.hpc.cineca.it/hpc-access/access-cineca-resources/iscra-projects/) and stay tuned for results!
