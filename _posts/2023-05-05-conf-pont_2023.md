I was invited to the PONT (Progress on Old and New Themes in Cosmology) Conference to give an overview talk of the particle and wave nature of dark matter.
The slides of my talk can be found [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1166693/contributions/5281049/attachments/2640893/4570890/2023_pont_avignon_hoof.pdf), and I hope that I could do justice to this fundamental, vast topic.

While this was not my first visit to the historically important city of Avignon, I must admit that was very young and did not remember much.
I really enjoyed the conference, filled with interesting talks and hosted in the impressive Papal Palace.
Heading to the old town for meals in town was also a highlight as eating out in France is rarely a disappointment.
