Today, I presented results from [our recent preprint](https://sebhoof.github.io/blog/2023/preprint-solar_tomography/) during the [Axions++ conference](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/29472/) in the picturesque city of Annecy, France.
The slides can be downloaded [here](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/29472/contributions/127573/attachments/79882/117234/2023_axionspp_annecy.pdf).
I would like to thank the organisers for putting together a varied programme of talks and excellent time-keeping!
