This week, I am enjoying the great hospitality of the _Osservatorio Astronomico d'Abruzzo_, which is astronomical observatory in Teramo, Italy.
I used the opportunity of my research visit to present results from one of my recent work in a hybrid format: on the one hand as the local seminar, and on the other hand remotely as the [CosmicWispers](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA21106/) colloquium (see also a [previous post](https://sebhoof.github.io/blog/2023/jc-cw/) about my CosmicWispers journal club).
I talked not only about some of my past and current research, but also about opportunities for the future if we discover axions or similar new particles.
