Today, I presented results from [our recent preprint](preprint-solar_tomography) during the conference week of the workshop ["Axions across boundaries between Particle Physics, Astrophysics, Cosmology and forefront Detection Technologies"](https://www.ggi.infn.it/showevent.pl?id=437) at the Galileo Galilei Institute (GGI) in Florence (Italy).
The workshop lasted for about seven weeks, and I had the pleasure of attending almost three of them.

It was one of my most memorable conference experiences, as the GGI became a hub of axion researchers from all around the world.
Thanks to our GGI office spaces and, more importantly, the great organisation by the hosts, we could meet, discuss, and work on our projects.
While investing such a significant amount of time is always a risk factor, I am glad that I had committed to this opportunity.
I am hopeful that many new collaborations and projects will come from this.
