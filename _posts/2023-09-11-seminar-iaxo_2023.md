The [IAXO Collaboration](https://iaxo.desy.de/) invited me to talk our recent article at their 18th collaboration meeting.
Since our results directly relate to their experiment, we were already in contact with them before releasing our preprint.
However, it is always exciting to hear the opinion of experimentalists once the initial version of the preprint comes out.
This is an important reality check since we as phenomenologists/theorists can sometimes get a bit ahead of ourselves.

I was also happy to learn that the participants and organisers found my presentation useful for their meeting, too.
As a nice gesture, they presented me with a certificate to acknowledge me "delivering an enlightening and impactful presentation", which I very much appreciate. üèÖ
