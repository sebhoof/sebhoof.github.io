As part of the outreach for the MSCA programme, I acted as a juror for the *Premio Asimov* award panel.
The *Premio Asimov* is one of the most prestigious awards for popular science books in the Italian language.
This edition's award went to professor Giovanni Covone for his book *Altre Terre: Viaggio alla scoperta di pianeti extrasolari* (HarperCollins Italia), which lets the reader explore the research into exoplanets and their potential importance for the future of the human species.
