As an early Christmas present, please consider reading our new preprint [on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04772).
Collaborating with my former MSc student and teo other researchers in Amsterdam and Padua, we took a closer look at our [model catalogue of axion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12378) in light of a recent observation that [axion models can imply an alternative cosmological history](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16087).
As a result, we find "model islands" below the usual axion window and, in case of a discovery, the catalogue might prove invaluable for identifying the observed axion model.
