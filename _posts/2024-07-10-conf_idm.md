Today, I presented results from our upcoming work on "ultimate" future laboratory searches for axion-like particles (see the related blog post [here](https://sebhoof.github.io/blog/2024/preprint-hyperlsw)) at the [IDM 2024 conference](https://www.idm2024.eu/).
The devastating 2009 earthquake destroyed much of the city of L'Aquila, so it is great to see that many of its buildings have been restored and filled again with life.
During the conference, we also had the chance to visit the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory, which hosts some of the most important [dark matter experiments](https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/research) in the entire world.
Needless to say that this made for a unique and insightful experience!
