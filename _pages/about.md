Hello there and welcome to my page! I&#39;m an astroparticle physicist on a mission to unravel at least some mysteries of the Universe.

My research centres around new particles, such as axions, which may explain the existence of dark matter and solve other mysteries of modern physics.
As a particle phenomenologist, I enjoy exploring the ways in which these particles would manifest themselves in the world around us.
While axions are a particular focus of mine, I&#39;m always excited about discovering new and exotic particles beyond the current standard model of particle physics.
Most of my research and [publications](/publications) involve these topics.

To gain insight into the properties of these particles, I use statistical analysis techniques such as global fits.
These allow us to combine all available information to learn as much as possible about the properties of fundamental particles.
As an applied statistician, I use both Bayesian and frequentist/classical statistics to gain insights from current and future data. I&#39;m also a member of the [GAMBIT](https://gambitbsm.org/) global fitting community.

Currently, I&#39;m based at the University of Padua in Italy, working on my Marie-Sk&#322;odowska-Curie fellowship project &#34;AxiTools.&#34;
Through this project, I seek to gain new insights into the properties of axions and other feebly interacting new particles.
Another important aim of the project is to improve the availability of open-source software for this field.

Thank you for stopping by, and please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or are interested in a collaboration.
