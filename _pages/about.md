Why, hello there!
I am a particle phenomenologist, meaning that I study how particles manifest themselves in the world around us.
This is mostly to figure out what dark matter is, but I can generally be excited about any new, exotic particles beyond the current standard model of particle physics.
My favourite hypothetical particle is called &ldquo;axion,&rdquo; which is what most of my research and [publications](/publications/) are about.

The most powerful way to learn about the properties of axions and other particles is via global fits, which is the idea of using all available information in a consistent statistical analysis.
Global fits are the common interest of the [GAMBIT](https://gambit.hepforge.org/) community, of which I am a member.
I am an opportunistic applied statistician, in the sense that I like to use both Bayesian and frequentist/classical statistics to learn as much as possible from the data have now and in the future.

I am currently based in Padua, Italy, where my Marie-Sk&#322;odowska-Curie fellowship &ldquo;AxiTools&rdquo; is funded by the European Union.
